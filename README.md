Description:
  Dump the memory of a Protected Process Light (PPL) with a *userland* exploit

Usage:
  PPLdump.exe [-v] [-d] [-f] <PROC_NAME|PROC_ID> <DUMP_FILE>

Arguments:
  PROC_NAME  The name of a Process to dump
  PROC_ID    The ID of a Process to dump
  DUMP_FILE  The path of the output dump file

Options:
  -v         (Verbose) Enable verbose mode
  -d         (Debug) Enable debug mode (implies verbose)
  -f         (Force) Bypass DefineDosDevice error check

Examples:
  PPLdump.exe lsass.exe lsass.dmp
  PPLdump.exe -v 720 out.dmp
```

## FAQ

### Does it work on all versions of Windows?

First of all, PPLs were introduced with Windows 8.1 so older versions of Windows are out of scope. This project mainly targets Windows 10 (and its server editions) but I also tested it on older versions. You will find a summary table of the tests I did in the eponymous section.

### How is it different from other tools?

Other PPL bypass tools usually execute arbitrary code in the Kernel through a digitally signed driver. This one is different as it involves only userland tricks and is (almost) fileless.

### "Userland", you say?!

This tool leverages a very clever trick that was initially discussed by James Forshaw in 2018 (see Credits). It involves the use of the `DefineDosDevice` API function to trick the system into creating an arbitrary Known DLL entry. Since PPLs do not check the digital signature of Known DLLs, this can be later used to perform a DLL hijacking attack and execute arbitrary code inside a PPL.

### Is it really "fileless"?

Although this tool performs a DLL hijacking attack as a second stage, it does not create a new DLL file on disk. Instead, it makes use of an NTFS transaction to virtually replace the content of an existing one, a technique directly inspired by the work of [@\_ForrestOrr](https://twitter.com/_ForrestOrr) (see Credits).

### Can this tool cause a DoS?

Ths short answer is "no". First, it does not involve any direct Kernel access so there is no risk of causing a BSOD from this standpoint. In the worst case scenario, the tool might fail to remove the created Known DLL entry but, this will not cause a Denial of Service. It will just stay there until the next machine reboot. As the created entry would just be a symbolic link pointing to a non-existent section, the system would eventually fall back to the default location (i.e. the `System32` folder) so it will not impact other programs running on the machine.

## Tests

| Windows version | Build | Edition | Arch | Admin | SYSTEM |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Windows 10 20H2 | 19042.870 | Pro | x64 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

- The execution paths for an administrator and `SYSTEM` are slightly different, hence the two separate columns in the table.
- Although the tool works on Windows 8.1, it fails on Windows Server 2012 R2 for some reason.

## Build instructions

This solution is composed of two projects (the executable and a payload DLL) that need to be compiled in a specific order. Everything is pre-configured, so you just have to follow these simple instructions. The compiled payload DLL is automatically embedded into the final executable.

1. Open the Solution with Visual Studio 2019.
2. Select `Release / x64` or `Release / x86` depending on the architecture of the target machine.
3. `Build > Build Solution`.
